# Statik ve Mukavemet: An Introduction to Statics and Strength of Materials
 
Statik ve Mukavemet is a book written by Mehmet Omurtag, a professor of civil engineering at Istanbul Technical University. The book aims to teach the basic concepts of statics and strength of materials, which are essential for engineering students. The book uses scalar mechanics instead of vector mechanics, which simplifies the mathematical background and the problem solving process. The book covers topics such as force and moment, equilibrium in plane, center of gravity, rigid body equilibrium in plane, truss and frame systems, cables, friction, internal forces, normal force, torsion, shear and bending, elastic stability, stress and strain in plane. The book also includes a Turkish-English technical dictionary, a solution key, and a list of references.

The book is available in PDF format online[^1^] [^2^] [^5^], as well as in print from Birsen YayÄ±nevi[^4^]. The book has 288 pages, 61 solved examples, and 356 end-of-chapter problems. The book is written in Turkish and uses the metric system of units. The book is suitable for undergraduate students of civil engineering, mechanical engineering, architecture, and other related fields.

Statics and strength of materials are two fundamental branches of mechanics that deal with the behavior of bodies under external forces. Statics focuses on the conditions for equilibrium, while strength of materials studies the internal stresses and deformations caused by the external forces. These topics are important for engineering design and analysis, as they help to ensure the safety and efficiency of structures and machines.
 
Statik ve Mukavemet is a book that aims to provide a clear and concise introduction to these topics, using scalar mechanics instead of vector mechanics. Scalar mechanics is a simpler approach that uses algebraic equations instead of vector operations. This makes the book more accessible for students who have a limited mathematical background or who prefer a more intuitive way of learning. The book also uses realistic examples and problems that relate to engineering applications and everyday situations.
 
The book is divided into two parts: statics and strength of materials. The first part covers topics such as force and moment, equilibrium in plane, center of gravity, rigid body equilibrium in plane, truss and frame systems, cables, and friction. The second part covers topics such as internal forces, normal force, torsion, shear and bending, elastic stability, stress and strain in plane. The book also includes a Turkish-English technical dictionary, a solution key, and a list of references. The book is written in Turkish and uses the metric system of units.

Statik ve Mukavemet is a book that offers a comprehensive and practical introduction to statics and strength of materials, using scalar mechanics instead of vector mechanics. The book is written by Mehmet Omurtag, a professor of civil engineering at Istanbul Technical University, who has extensive experience in teaching and research in these fields. The book is intended for undergraduate students of civil engineering, mechanical engineering, architecture, and other related fields, as well as for anyone who wants to learn the basics of mechanics.
 
The book is organized into two parts: statics and strength of materials. Each part consists of several chapters that cover the main concepts and principles of the subject. The book also includes a Turkish-English technical dictionary, a solution key, and a list of references. The book has 288 pages, 61 solved examples, and 356 end-of-chapter problems. The book is written in Turkish and uses the metric system of units.
 
The book is available in PDF format online  , as well as in print from Birsen YayÄ±nevi. The book has received positive feedback from students and instructors who have used it as a textbook or a reference. The book is praised for its clarity, simplicity, and relevance. The book is also recommended for anyone who wants to refresh their knowledge of statics and strength of materials.
